#### An Event Registration System with QR Code functionality is a modern and efficient way to manage event registration and check-in processes. QR codes are scannable two-dimensional barcodes that can store information, such as attendee details and event-related data. Here's a general outline of how such a system would work:

#### 1. **Event Setup and Registration:**

   - Event Organizer creates the event in the system, specifying details like event name, date, time, location, ticket types, and registration deadlines.

   - Attendees can register for the event through a website or mobile app by providing their information, selecting ticket types, and making payments if required.

2. **QR Code Generation:**

   - After successful registration and payment (if applicable), the system generates a unique QR code for each attendee.

   - The QR code contains relevant information about the attendee and their ticket, encrypted within the code.

3. **Email Confirmation:**

   - The system can automatically send an email to each registered attendee, confirming their registration and including the QR code as an attachment or a link to download.

4. **Check-in Process:**

   - On the day of the event, event staff (or self-service kiosks) are equipped with QR code scanners or mobile devices with scanning capabilities.

   - Attendees present their QR codes at the event entrance, and the staff scans the QR code with the scanning devices.

5. **Validation and Check-in:**

   - The system verifies the scanned QR code against the registered attendee database to ensure its authenticity and validity.

   - If the QR code is valid and hasn't been used before, the attendee's check-in status is marked as "checked-in" in the system, and they are allowed entry to the event.

6. **Real-time Tracking and Analytics:**

   - The event organizer can access real-time data on the number of attendees checked-in, attendance patterns, and other useful analytics.

   - This data can help manage event logistics and make informed decisions during the event.

#### Benefits of an Event Registration System with QR Code:

- Faster and more efficient check-in process.

- Reduced chances of fraudulent entry or ticket duplication.

- Improved attendee experience with streamlined registration and check-in.

- Real-time data and analytics to monitor event performance.

- Less reliance on printed materials, saving costs and being environmentally friendly.
As technology continues to advance, QR codes have become a popular choice for event management due to their simplicity and convenience. They enhance the overall event experience for both organizers and attendees..

This was my first big project so there are lot of things to improve upon

- CSS code is totally messed up :pensive: (some code in file and some inline)
- Frontend can be made more nicer (PS: I suck at frontend development) :cry:	
- More data can be collected manually via web scrapping to make the system more functional & attractive :monocle_face:
